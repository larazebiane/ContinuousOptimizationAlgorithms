# Continuous Optimization Algorithms Repository

Welcome to this repository, which contains implementations of various optimization algorithms primarily focused on unconstrained minimization and related methods. This repository is organized into modular folders, each containing different solvers and utilities for solving nonlinear optimization problems.

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides MATLAB implementations of several classical optimization techniques, including:

- Unconstrained minimization solvers using Newton and Conjugate Gradient methods.
- Trust-region methods for unconstrained optimization with advanced subproblem solvers.
- Projected gradient methods for Binary Quadratic Programming problems.

The algorithms are designed to be flexible, allowing easy experimentation with different line searches, step strategies, and Hessian approximations.
